## Lab - Class 07 - Custom Servers with Node and Express

**Author**: Rey Mercado
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

In this lab assignment, I will begin building my own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that my server will manage.

Convert the `README.md` file to be documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development. Check the "documentation" section of the lab assignment for more details on how that should look AT MINIMUM.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Process

For every lab in this module, you will have a new partner. You and your new partner(s) will spend the first 30 minutes reviewing each other’s code from the previous lab and planning out an approach to this lab’s work on a whiteboard.

Do a formal code review of each person’s code (10 minutes each).
Open your partner’s GitHub pull request on your laptop.
Identify an area in the code that:
you don’t understand
or seems overly complex
or you see a way to improve
or you want more information on
or you really like or think is interesting
Add kind comments or questions inline using the GitHub review feature.
Draw the web request-response cycle for the current lab tasks (about 10 minutes).
Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
Outline the functions that support this data flow.
Be sure to include these drawings in your README.md.
You will then work independently for the rest of the day, implementing your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

## Change Log

Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
